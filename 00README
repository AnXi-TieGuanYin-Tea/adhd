o On Chromium OS, this daemon is started by the audiopolicy.conf
  Upstart script.

o Existence of alsactl and amixer are checked by sound_infrastructure
  test.

o The addition of the 'asound.state' files to the 'factory-default' is
  not the best practice to use when managing many different boards.
  If you are trying to use this package as example of extensibility to
  support many boards, please consult with micahc@, tlambert@ or
  thutt@ before copying this model, as this source tree is in flux
  right now, and we are hoping to get rid of these asound.state files
  in favor of udev rules.
