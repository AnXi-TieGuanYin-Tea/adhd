CRAS = ChromeOS Audio Server

Directories
src/server - the source for the sound server
src/libcras - client library for interacting with cras
src/common - files common to both the server and library
src/tests - tests for cras and libcras

Building from source:
./git_prepare.sh
./configure

Configuration:
---------------------

There can be a config file for each sound alsa card on the system.  This file
lives in /etc/cras/.  The file should be named with the card name returned by
ALSA, the string in the first set of '[]' in the aplay -l output.  The ini file
has the following format.

[<output-node-name>] ; Name of the mixer control for this output.
  "<config-option>":"<config-value>"

output-node-name is the mixer control name, e.g. "Headphone" or "Speaker".
config-option can be the following:
  volume_curve - The type of volume curve, only "simple_step" is allowed.
  max_volume - The maximum volume for this output specified in dBFS * 100.
  volume_step - Number of dB per volume 'tick' specified in  dBFS * 100.

Example:
This example configures the Headphones to have a max volume of 3dB with a step
size of 0.75dB and the speakers to have a max volume of 6dB with a step of
1dB.

[Headphone]
  "volume_curve":"simple_step"
  "volume_step":"75"
  "max_volume":"-300"
[Speaker]
  "volume_curve":"simple_step"
  "volume_step":"100"
  "max_volume":"-600"
